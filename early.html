    My story begins in a small one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Chinatown of New York City. 
	    My parents worked arduously to put food on the table and provide clothes for me and my little sister.
	    Up until the age of 10, I never truly had a place to call home. We were always on the move from one apartment to the next. 
	    No matter where we went, we could not escape tragedy. I attended Staten Island Tech because I wanted to challenge myself 
	    and position myself in the best way possible for success. At Tech, I touched on the values of leadership and camaraderie. 
	    I co-founded the Red Cross Club to provide my peers with the necessary education for emergency assistance, disaster relief, 
	    and disaster preparedness. Upholding the responsibilities of president, I was given the opportunity to step beyond my comfort 
	    zone and help underclassmen get involved with the community as well as prepare myself for my future endeavors at Cornell.

	    On my first visit to Cornell, I was certain this was where I wanted to spend my most transforamtive years.
	    So far, I've met some of the brightest and most driven individuals. My goal is to capitalize on all the unique
	    opportunities Cornell has to offer to make my experience here truly unforgetable.

	    My family is reason I am the man today, showing me that you don't need a lot to do a lot, 
	    I was taught that the accurate metric of my self worth is not how I feel about my positive experiences, 
	    rather it's how I respond to my negative ones. Of course, I still have my insecurities — we all do —  
	    but now my focus is on building my professional portfolio and forming positive relationships with my love ones.
