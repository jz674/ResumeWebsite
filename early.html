    My story begins in a small one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Chinatown of New York City. My parents worked arduously to put food on the table and provide clothes for me and my little sister. Up until the age of 10, I never truly had a place to call home. We were always on the move from one apartment to the next. No matter where we went, we could not escape tragedy. I attended Staten Island Tech because I wanted to challenge myself and position myself in the best way possible for success. At Tech, I touched on the values of leadership and camaraderie. I co-founded the Red Cross Club to provide my peers with the necessary education for emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness. Upholding the responsibilities of president, I was given the opportunity to step beyond my comfort zone and help underclassmen get involved with the community as well as prepare myself for my future endeavors at Cornell.

    When I first laid eyes on Cornell’s beautiful campus, I was certain I wanted to come here. The friends I’ve made, the professors I’ve connected with and the unique opportunities I’ve capitalized on at Cornell have all truly made my experience one of its kind.

    Once admitted, I immediately consulted with university alumni regarding my best path moving forward. My decision to study Computer Science followed shortly as I saw the values and potentials in the major. Last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at a startup to gain experience in the backend of the company. However, next summer, I want more exposure on the business development side of the company in addition to honing my software development skills. I find this to be very valuable because currently I lack the business acumen necessary to take my ideas and technology skills and turn it into a business venture.

    Since this is my personal website, I wish to share something deep and meaningful to me. Because of family emergencies, many of which happened during the semester and required me absolute attention, I felt inhibited, forever confined by what the world may think of me. Unambitious and unmotivated due to a dangerously uncertain and strife filled home life, it was last summer that I came to the startling realization there were no reasons to give in to my problems, fears, or shame. I had spent the majority of my life worrying about life’s trivialities, avoiding the painful fact that my life was falling apart. The truth was that it was okay. The accurate metric of my self worth is not how I feel about my positive experiences, but rather how I react to my negative ones. This summer, I grew emotionally and became more ambitious. I decided to be proactive and reclaim control of my life by developing better values. Of course, I still have my insecurities — we all do —  but now my focus is on more critical matters, such as building my professional portfolio and forming positive relationships with friends and family.

    My family difficulties have forced me to solve real life problems and adapt quickly to stressful situations. As a result, this has made me more responsible with a deeper understanding of patience and deliberation. Currently, I am applying these ideas to my academics. Hopefully it works out great :)
