    My story begins in a small one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Chinatown of New York City. My parents worked constantly to provide food on the table and clothes on me and my little sister. Up until the age of 10, I never truly had a place I called home. We were always on the move from one apartment to the next. No matter where we went, we could not escape tragedy. I attend Staten Island Tech because I wanted to challenge myself and position myself in the best way possible for success. At Tech, I touched on the values of leadership and camaraderie. I founded the Red Cross Club to provide my peers with necessary education for emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness. Upholding the responsibilities of president, I was offered the opportunity to step beyond my comfort zone to help underclassmen get involved with the community and help prepare me for my future endeavors at Cornell.

    On my first visit of Cornell University, I knew I wanted to come here. What I had no idea about were the brilliant minds I would encounter and the unique opportunities Cornell has to offer.

    Once admitted, I immediately consulted with university alumni regarding my best path moving forward. My decision to study Computer Science followed shortly as I saw the values and potentials in the major. Last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at a startup to gain experience in the backend of the company. However, next summer, I want more exposure on the business development side of the company in addition to software development. I find this to be very valuable because currently I lack the business acumen necessary to take my ideas and technology skills and turn it into a business venture.

    Since this is my personal website, I wish to share something deep and meaningful to me. Because of family emergencies, many of which happened during the semester and required me absolute attention, I felt inhibited, forever confined by what the world may think of me. Unambitious and unmotivated due to a dangerously uncertain and strife filled home life, it was last summer that I came to the startling realization there were no reasons to give in to my problems, fears, or shame. I had spent the majority of my life worrying about life’s trivialities, avoiding the painful fact that my life was falling apart. The truth was that it was okay. The accurate metric of my self worth is not how I feel about my positive experiences, but rather how I react to my negative ones. This summer, I grew emotionally and became more ambitious. I decided to be proactive and reclaim control of my life by developing better values. Of course, I still have my insecurities — we all do —  but now my focus is on more critical matters, such as building my professional portfolio and forming positive relationships with friends and family.
    </span>
    <span>
    My family difficulties have enabled me to solve real life problems and thus made me more responsible with a deeper understanding of patience and deliberation. Currently, I am applying my life lessons to academia. Hopefully it works out great :)
