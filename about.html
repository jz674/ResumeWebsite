    Before I began my studies in Computer Science at Cornell University’s College of Engineering, I went through a series of personal explorations and transformation to uncover that "perfect" major. However, after numerous consulting with advisors and mentors, I came to the conclusion that the major I chose would not define my future, rather it'd provide me the resources and insight needed to inspire my personal and professional ambitions. I now recognize that hard work and diligence are the true determinants of a rewarding future.

    My passion lies in the intersection of Entrepreneurship and Computer Science, focusing on discovering technological and financial gaps in the market and acting on various opportunities. I strive to continuously evolve and develop my business acumen with a vision to become a leader in the technological revolution. With that in mind, giving back to the people and the communities that have supported me throughout my life is just as meaningful to me and a value I plan to uphold throughout my lifetime. To achieve my goals, I am on a constant lookout for opportunities to surround myself with inspiring individuals and to better myself day by day, both of which are qualities that embody a distinguished entrepreneur.
