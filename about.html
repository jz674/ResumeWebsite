      Before beginning my studies in Computer Science at Cornell University, 
      I went through a series of personal explorations to uncover my "perfect" major.
      I came to the conclusion that what I choose would not define my future, rather it will be my grit,
      self-determination, and personal ambition that will dictate my success and place in society.

      My passion lies in the intersection of Entrepreneurship and Computer Science with a strong
      focus on discovering technological gaps in the market and executing on opportunities. 
      I strive to continuously personal improvement with a vision to become a leader in the 
      technological revolution, inspiring and uplifting others along my journey.
