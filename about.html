    Before I began my studies in Computer Science at Cornell University’s College of Engineering, I went through a series of personal explorations to uncover the "perfect" major for myself and my professional career. After consulting with numeruous advisors and mentors, I came to the conclusion that my major will not define my future. Rather it will be my hard work and determination that dictate where I end up. My major and studies will serve as tools for me to aspire my personal and professional realizations!

    My passion lies in the intersection of Entrepreneurship and Computer Science, focusing on business model and building the gap on various opportunities in the technology/finanical market. One day, I hope to develop the business acumen necessary to become a leader in the technological revolution that dawns upon us and give back to the people and communities that have supported me throughout my journey. To achieve my long-term goals, I am on a constant lookout for opportunities to improve my values, leadership abilities, self-awareness and various other important qualities that embodies a successful entrepreneur.
