          I really mean it when I say I am fortunate. 
          My family came to America empty-handed. We were at rock bottom, so
          the only direction to go was up. From a young age, I witness my mother single handedly
          taking care of me while working a 9-5 job. My father was the purest definition of a workaholic, leaving the house at
          5am, coming home at 2am, and sleeping in during the weekends; I rarely saw him. 
          After graduating high school, I discovered new found appreciation and admiration for my parents' sacrifices. 
          They are my biggest role models. And even though they're not perfect, I love them!
