        <p><span>
          I really mean it when I say I am fortunate. 
          My family immigrated to America with $30,000 debt - mom and dad worked night and day tirelessly for years to start from 0. We were at rock bottom, so
          the only direction to go was up. 
          </p></span>
          
          <p><span>
          From my earlier memories, my mother single-handedly took care of me and my little sister while working 9-5 waiting tables. My dad would leave the house
          before dawn and come back at 2am - pure workaholic. I rarely saw him, yet I understood he had to do what was best for the family. 
          </span></p>
    
          <p><span>
          After graduating high school, I discovered new found appreciation and admiration for my parents' sacrifices. 
          They are my biggest role models. And even though they're not perfect, I love them!
        </span></p>
